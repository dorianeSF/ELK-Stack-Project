### Ansible Directory
This directory contains the scripts used to install ELK, Filebeat, and Metricbeat
This directory is divided into two main folders:
- [ansible_playbooks](ansible_playbooks)
  - These are the playbooks I created to install the ELK-Stack, Filebeat, and Metricbeat.
- [config_files](config_files)
  - These are the configuration files that you will need to configure in order to successfully deploy the ELK-Stack, Filebeat, and Metricbeat.
These files may be downloaded as needed for your own installations.
